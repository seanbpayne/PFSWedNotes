# Actions
## Turn Order
1. Start of turn
    * Fast Healing (if any)
2. Actions
3. End of Turn
    * If dying roll a flat check (DC 10 + current dying value). If your dying reaches 0 then you are unconcious but stable. Anytime you loose the dying condition you increase your wounded by 1.
        * Critical Success Your dying value is reduced by 2.
        * Success Your dying value is reduced by 1.
        * Failure Your dying value increases by 1 (plus your wounded value, if any).
        * Critical Failure Your dying value increases by 2 (plus your wounded value, if any).
    * If you are taking persistant damage
    * If you are subject to an affliction and have reached the end of a stage you must make a new saving throw. If you reduce the stage below 1 then the affliction ends. If you would increase the stage beyond the highest level then repeat the effects of the highest stage.
        * Critical Success: reduce the stage by 2 (virulant afflictions only reduce by 1)
        * Success: reduce the stage by 1 (virulent afflictions require two successes to reduce the stage by 1)
        * Failure: increase the stage by 1
        * Critical Failure: increase the stage by 2

## Exploration Actions

## Adjudicating (GMC27)
### Aid
It’s up to you whether someone’s preparation is enough to let them Aid an ally. The preparation should be specific to the task at hand. Helping someone hold a lockpick steady might be enough preparation to Aid an attempt to Pick a Lock, but just saying you’re going to “encourage” them likely wouldn’t. Second, the character who’s attempting to Aid needs to be in a proper position to help and able to convey any necessary information. Helping a character Climb a wall is pretty tough if the character a PC wishes to Aid is nowhere near them. Similarly, a character usually needs to be next to their ally or a foe to Aid the ally in attacking the foe. You’ll also need to determine how long the preparation takes. Typically, a single action is sufficient to help with a task that’s completed in a single round, but to help someone perform a long-term task, like research, the character has to help until the task is finished.)

### Counteracting
PC431
### Ready
The Ready activity lets the acting person choose the trigger for their readied action. However, you might sometimes need to put limits on what they can choose. Notably, the trigger must be something that happens in the game world and is observable by the character, rather than a rules concept that doesn’t exist in-world. For instance, if a player says, “I Ready to shoot an arrow at her if she uses a concentrate action” or “I Ready to attack him if he has fewer than forty-seven Hit Points,” find out what their character is trying to specifically observe. If they don’t have a clear answer for that, they need to adjust their action.

### Seek
The Seek action leaves it up to you how long a search should take. Use common sense. Most of the time, just trying to spot a creature hiding in a small area, or something else you could find with a simple Seek action rather than a long-term Search exploration activity, should default to a single action. The biggest distinction is whether something uses 3 actions or fewer—and can therefore be accomplished in a single turn—or requires significantly longer and can’t be accomplished in an encounter at all. Consider whether it makes sense for the character to pull this off during the encounter or not, and whether that could be an interesting wrinkle in the story.

### Sense Motive
When someone tries to Sense the Motive of an NPC, you’ll need to figure out how to convey the information they receive. It’s best to try to convey this indirectly, such as by describing a lying target’s body language, odd word choices, sweating, or other details rather than saying, “They aren’t behaving normally.” However, sometimes dropping a punchy, “Oh, she is a hundred percent lying about this!” on a critical success can be satisfying. You also might need to determine when the situation changes enough for someone to try to Sense Motive again. Usually, this means either the behavior of the subject needs to change or the person attempting the check needs to receive new evidence that something is out of the ordinary. If another PC tries to Sense Motive, gets different information about the target, and shares it, that doesn’t really count as new information for a PC who tried previously. Rather, it’s up to the players to roleplay out any changes in their thinking as a result.

### Take Cover
You’ll often need to determine whether someone can Take Cover. They usually just need a large enough object to hide behind. Imagine the character crouching, and picture whether the object could almost entirely cover up their silhouette. Taking Cover might also require them to Drop Prone, such as if they want to take cover under a table. Most of the time, you can let them combine these instead of using two separate actions.

# Modifying
**Modifier order:** (Double or Half), apply immunities, weaknesses and resistances (in that order)

**Doubling:** Roll all dice and then double

**Halfing:** Roll all dice and then take half, round down (minimum 1)

**Increasing Die size:** 1d4 » 1d6» 1d8 » 1d10 »1d12 (can’t go beyond 1d12, can’t increase by more than 1)
# Conditions
* **Wounded:** You loose the wounded condition when someone uses Treat Wounds to restore HP or you are restored to full HP by any means and rest for 10 min.

## Special
**Incapacitation** (trait) An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and it’s harder to use on a more powerful character. If a spell has the incapacitation trait, any creature of more than twice the spell’s rank treats the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated by the spell as one degree of success better, or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse. If any other effect has the incapacitation trait, a creature of higher level than the item, creature, or hazard generating the effect gains the same benefits.

**Nonlethal:** If the last attack has the non-lethal trait, the opponent is knocked out instead of killed. You can attack with a weapon at -2 to give it the nonlethal trait. An attack with the nonlethal trait can do lethal damage with a -2 penalty.

# Special Situations
