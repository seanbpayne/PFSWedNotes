## Trick Traits
**Aerial (Acrobatics):** The trick involves flight by either magical or mundane means.

**Air (Survival):** The trick involves the manipulation of mist, wind, or another prop with atmospheric properties.

**Alchemical:** As part of the trick, the performer can expend one alchemical item in their possession. Upon doing so, the performer gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their trick check. This destroys the item.

**Agile:** The penalty for performing an agile trick a second or third time in the same act is –4 or –8, respectively, instead of –5 or –10.

**Animal (Nature):** The trick utilizes trained animals.

**Audience (Society):** The audience participates in the trick.

**Beast (Arcana):** The trick relies on intelligent beasts.

**Dance:** The trick involves dancing or choreographed movements. Circumstance bonuses to trick checks gained from performers using the Costar reaction (page 65) stack. For example, if two other PCs successfully Costar with their ally and have the master proficiency rank in that trick check, the total circumstance bonus granted from the Costar reaction is +6 (rather than +3).

**Earth (Occultism):** The trick involves the use of mud, earth, or stone.

**Emotion:** The trick uses alchemical or magical effects to induce a powerful emotional response from the audience. A trick must have either the alchemical or magical trait in order to have the emotion trait. Whenever a performer succeeds or critically succeeds at a trick check with the emotion trait, they can reduce the amount of Excitement or Anticipation (or both) the trick generates however they wish, down to a minimum of 0
Excitement or Anticipation.

**Explosive^:** Tricks with the explosive trait call attention away from other acts distracting them from slight mistakes. This trick gains the injury trait but other tricks performed at the same time have -1 to their DC

**Fire (Intimidation):** This trick involves fire, smoke, or pyrotechnics. 

**Injury*:** Anytime a PC uses a saving throw for one of the trick checks, the trick has this trait. If an NPC or PC performing a trick with the injury trait critically fails any trick check, they have a chance of becoming injured. To determine if the performer is injured, roll a flat DC 15 check. On a failure, the performer becomes injured. An injured performer (whether PC or NPC) cannot perform tricks for the rest of the show. In addition, at the beginning of the next show, the injured performer must succeed at a flat DC 15 check to determine if they have recovered sufficiently to perform again. On a failure, the performer cannot perform in that show, either due to the lasting effects of the injury or due to fright of becoming injured again. A performer can miss only one show after the show in which they were injured. On subsequent shows, no check is necessary and the PC or NPC can once again perform as normal.

**Juggling*:** This act involves some form of keeping multiple objects in the air at the same time.

**Magical:** The trick involves the use of magic. While Performing the Trick, the performer can expend one spell slot of any level. If the performance succeeds or critically succeeds, the trick generates an additional amount of Excitement equal to the expended spell slot’s level.

**Musical (Performance):** The trick involves musical cues or is somehow augmented by sound effects or music. 

**Plant (Nature):** The trick uses plants such as trees, flowers, or fungi, or uses magic that affects such plants. Prop (Crafting): The trick requires the use of some mundane prop or stage setup.

**Slight of Hand (Thievery)^:** A trick with this trait directs audience eyes away from quick fingers, aces up sleeves and other sneaky yet mundane tricks.

**Team**: This trick requires more than one person. Anytime a PC performing a signature trick accepts the Costar reaction from a performer, the trick has this trait. 

**Time:** The trick involves distorting or altering time in some way. A performer whose trick has the time trait can perform that trick one additional time per act, taking a penalty to the fourth trick check equal to the penalty to the third trick check.

**Water (Athletics):** The trick features water as a primary component of its performance.

## Trick Equipment

## Non-performer Roles
**Animal Handler:** Trick checks with the animal trait gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and a PC whose signature trick has the animal trait can perform twice in the same show (though not in the same act). If the animals break loose event is rolled on Table 3: Random Circus Events (below), reroll on that table instead.

**Backup Clown:** Performers can Send in the Clowns one additional time per act.

**Bandleader:** After each trick is completed, the bandleader can choose to generate Anticipation equal to half the bandleader’s level rounded up. The circus must have the acoustics permanent upgrade (page 69) before a PC can choose the bandleader role.

**Clown Coordinator:** You can Send in the Clowns as a reaction instead of using 1 action.

**Costumer:** Performers get a +1 circumstance bonus to trick checks with the audience trait.

**Pyrotechnic:** Trick checks with the fire trait generate double Excitement.

**Security Guard:** Any rolls of hecklers or scalpers on Table 3: Random Circus Events are negated and have no effect on the performance.

**Stooge^:** Performers get a +1 circumstance bonus to trick checks with the Audience or Drag trait.

## Random Circus Events

**Bad Weather:** Trick checks with the aerial or fire trait take a –2 circumstance penalty and trick checks with the earth trait gain a +2 circumstance bonus. If the show is a success, the Payout is doubled.

**Food Poisoning:** Trick checks take a –1 circumstance penalty. The GM randomly selects two trick traits; trick checks with those traits take a –2 circumstance penalty.

**Injured Performer:** One of the PCs (chosen randomly) cannot perform during this show. The PC can still take on a non-performer role.

**Missing Child^:** You must roll Perception against your Level Based DC+5 in order to find the child. Each round you spend searching for the child before the show leads to a stacking +1 penalty to Trick DCs during the show as you spend less time preparing and more time searching
