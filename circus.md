# Tricks

Optional rules: 
* **Easier Trick:** Perform the trick at a lower level for a lower DC. Additional trick checks in the same act can only go up, never down.
* **Harder Trick:** Add the injury tag to a trick that did not have it or increase the DC by 2 if it already had the injury tag. If you succeed at the trick check you gain additional excitement equal to half your trick level.

## Performing a Trick
Make a trick check against a DC equal to the performer's level DC.
* **Success** Gain excitement equal to the trick/PC level, 
* **Critical Success:** Gain excitement equal to the trick’s level AND anticipation equal to half the trick’s level (round up). 
* **Failure** No effect.
* **Critical failure** Lose excitement equal to half the trick’s level (round up) and if it has the injury trait requires the performer to make a DC 15 flat check or become injured (cannot perform for the rest of the show, maybe longer).

You can make multiple trick checks as part of an act, with a pentalty similar to the multi-attack penalty. The second attempts per takes a -5 penalty, The third (and greater) attempts take a -10 penalty. 

Once per act can send in the clowns (costs one action) for one trick check. This raises a Critical Failure to a failure or a failure to a success.

## Building
| Trick Level | Benefits |
|:-----------:|:--------:|
| 1 | 1 trick check, 1 trick trait |
| 4 | 2 trick checks, 1 trick trait |
| 8 | 2 trick checks, 2 trick traits |
| 12 | 2 trick checks, 3 trick traits |
| 16 | 3 trick checks, 3 trick traits |
| 20 | 3 trick checks, 4 trick traits |

A check is a Skill check, attack roll, or save. 

A PC must have access to a trait to add it to their signature trick; to gain access to a trait, the circus must have hired an NPC performer whose trick includes that trait.

If a trick trait’s name is followed by the name of a skill in parentheses, then a performer gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Perform a Trick with that trait using that skill check. For example, a performer whose trick has the aerial trick trait gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics trick checks.

### Additional Circus Trick
Feat 3

**Tags:** General Circus

**Prerequisite:** You must have a signature trick.

Your signature trick can have one additional trait beyond the number provided in Table 2: Trick Progression on page 63 of Pathfinder #151: The Show Must Go On. If the trick trait has an associated skill (such as Intimidation with the fire trait) and that skill is one of your trick checks, your checks with that skill to Perform a Trick aren’t penalized if you Perform a Trick using a different skill. For example, if your signature trick has Acrobatics and Intimidation as trick checks and you take this feat to add the fire trait, you can Perform a Trick using Acrobatics (at no penalty), then Acrobatics again (at a -5 penalty), and then Intimidation (at no penalty).

### Improving NPC Tricks
**Prerequisite:** You must be at least the level of the trick to be improved and have check bonus equal to 10 + level appropriate DC.

Work with an NPC to improve their trick. Spend 7 days working with them

* Critical Success Your attempt is successful. The trick greatly benefits from your guidance and work. Improve the level of the trick by +1 and they get a +1 in the trick check.
* Success Your attempt is successful. The trick benefits from your guidance and work. Improve the level of the trick by +1 or they gain +1 to the trick check.
* Failure Your attempt is unsuccessful. The trick is unaffected.
* Critical Failure Your attempt is unsuccessful. The performers are demoralized or confused by your attempts to improve the show. Level of the trick is changed by -1.

## Trick Equipment
Generic item bonuses always apply.

* Special gear for a trick is available at level 3, costs 50 gp and gives a +1 item bonus. Magical gear is also available at level 8, costs 450 gp, gives a +2 item bonus. Greater magical gear is available at level 16, costs 9,000 gp and gives a +3 item bonus.
* Costume changes: PCs can go on to support other characters with a costume change. 

## Available Trick Traits
**Agile:** The penalty for performing an agile trick a second or third time in the same act is –4 or –8, respectively, instead of –5 or –10.

**Alchemical:** As part of the trick, the performer can expend one alchemical item in their possession. Upon doing so, the performer gains a +1 circumstance bonus to their trick check. This destroys the item.

**Animal (Nature):** The trick utilizes trained animals.

**Fire (Intimidation):** This trick involves fire, smoke, or pyrotechnics. 

**Injury:** Anytime a PC uses a saving throw for one of the trick checks, the trick has this trait. If an NPC or PC performing a trick with the injury trait critically fails any trick check, they have a chance of becoming injured. To determine if the performer is injured, roll a flat DC 15 check. On a failure, the performer becomes injured. An injured performer (whether PC or NPC) cannot perform tricks for the rest of the show. In addition, at the beginning of the next show, the injured performer must succeed at a flat DC 15 check to determine if they have recovered sufficiently to perform again. On a failure, the performer cannot perform in that show, either due to the lasting effects of the injury or due to fright of becoming injured again. A performer can miss only one show after the show in which they were injured. On subsequent shows, no check is necessary and the PC or NPC can once again perform as normal.

**Prop (Crafting):** The trick requires the use of some mundane prop or stage setup.

**Team**: This trick requires more than one person. Anytime a PC performing a signature trick accepts the Costar reaction from a performer, the trick has this trait. 

**Water (Athletics):** The trick features water as a primary component of its performance.

## Unavailable Trick Traits

**Aerial (Acrobatics):** The trick involves flight by either magical or mundane means.

**Air (Survival):** The trick involves the manipulation of mist, wind, or another prop with atmospheric properties.

**Audience (Society):** The audience participates in the trick.

**Beast (Arcana):** The trick relies on intelligent beasts.

**Dance:** The trick involves dancing or choreographed movements. Circumstance bonuses to trick checks gained from performers using the Costar reaction (page 65) stack. For example, if two other PCs successfully Costar with their ally and have the master proficiency rank in that trick check, the total circumstance bonus granted from the Costar reaction is +6 (rather than +3).

**Earth (Occultism):** The trick involves the use of mud, earth, or stone.

**Emotion:** The trick uses alchemical or magical effects to induce a powerful emotional response from the audience. A trick must have either the alchemical or magical trait in order to have the emotion trait. Whenever a performer succeeds or critically succeeds at a trick check with the emotion trait, they can reduce the amount of Excitement or Anticipation (or both) the trick generates however they wish, down to a minimum of 0
Excitement or Anticipation.

**Explosive^:** Tricks with the explosive trait call attention away from other acts distracting them from slight mistakes. This trick gains the injury trait but other tricks performed at the same time have -1 to their DC.

**Juggling:** This act involves some form of keeping multiple objects in the air at the same time.

**Magical:** The trick involves the use of magic. While Performing the Trick, the performer can expend one spell slot of any level. If the performance succeeds or critically succeeds, the trick generates an additional amount of Excitement equal to the expended spell slot’s level.

**Musical (Performance):** The trick involves musical cues or is somehow augmented by sound effects or music. 

**Plant (Nature):** The trick uses plants such as trees, flowers, or fungi, or uses magic that affects such plants. Prop (Crafting): The trick requires the use of some mundane prop or stage setup.

**Slight of Hand (Thievery)^:** A trick with this trait directs audience eyes away from quick fingers, aces up sleeves and other sneaky yet mundane tricks.

**Time:** The trick involves distorting or altering time in some way. A performer whose trick has the time trait can perform that trick one additional time per act, taking a penalty to the fourth trick check equal to the penalty to the third trick check.
