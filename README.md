# Out of Character Notes
## Rules
* We are playing with the Free Archetype
* No uncommon or rare without asking
* I’m fine with players rolling “secret” checks if they are willing to roleplay not knowing if they fail
* Hero points can’t turn a failure into a critical failure
### Clang-Clang
If a PC is out of hero points and fail an important check they can appeal to Clang-Clan to give them a reroll. This is a Fortune effect.
