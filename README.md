# Out of Character Notes
## Rules
* We are playing with the Free Archetype
* No uncommon or rare without asking
* I’m fine with players rolling what should be “secret” checks if they are willing to roleplay not knowing if they fail
* All characters get Circus Lore as a bonus skill
### Clang-Clang's boons
Clang-Clang is a demigod of the circus and looks favorably on circus performers. He aligns to Desna
* Rerolling with a hero point gives a +1 circumstance bonus to the reroll.
* Hero points can’t turn a failure into a critical failure
* If a PC is out of hero points and fail an important check they can appeal to Clang-Clan to give them a reroll. This is a Fortune effect.
* There are other possible uses of a hero point. You can trade a hero point for a two-action heal spell, cast at the highest level that a caster of the PC's level could cast (no more than once per session, only during exploration mode).
